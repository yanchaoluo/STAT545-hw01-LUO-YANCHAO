## Hobbies

#### My favorite sport is basketball.

 Dwyane Wade is my favorite player.

  [link to the page abount Dwyane Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade)

>  Dwyane Wade said "fall down 7 times ,stand up 8" 

 His words inspired me when I was in trouble.

 I wrote a code about my favorite player for you.
 (Answer need to use quotation marks and write in full name, not use ~~wade~~, ~~Dwyane wade~~, ~~"wade"~~ )


##### Who is Yanchao's favorite basketball player?
      
```R

answer<- function(x) {
  
  if(x =="Dwyane wade") {
    print('right')
  }
  else {
    print('wrong')
  }
}
```
#### Another one is Running

If the weather is good, I will go outside running during the weekends.

Here are some reasons why

## How I got the changes into README.md
I tried to edit the README.md in the browser at github.com when I first used github. Then I found that it was very inconvenient for layout.
So I tried to edit locally and then Pushed to GitHub. I created a file called "homework 1" and made a connection from Github to my computer.
Every time when I added some information I will saved my changes, then used "Commit" button to send my changes to my repo. The last thing was pushing the commit to GitHub.

## Reflections
I find some problems when I did the first assignment. Firstly, when I wanted to use "section headers" Markdown syntax, I often forgot the space after the pound sign. This will lead to make an error after pushing local changes to Github. Then I learned how to find Where is the link of the picture on the website. For each image, clicking right find the original address of the image. Moreover, I do not know how to design a talking chart in R to create a window showing of options of basketball players. 

In addtion, for the first assignment, I find there is a very useful website for [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). For the R markdown document, it is very easy for me to repete what we studied in class. And here is the link:
[gapminder.Rmd ](https://github.com/yanchaoluo/STAT545-hw01-LUO-YANCHAO/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.Rmd), 
[gapminder.md ](https://github.com/yanchaoluo/STAT545-hw01-LUO-YANCHAO/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md), 
and [gapminder_files](https://github.com/yanchaoluo/STAT545-hw01-LUO-YANCHAO/tree/master/hw01_gapminder_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers)
